# Media Library

This project aimed to make content research easy with an effective tool. Unfortunately, due to frequent changes in YouTube's policies, the packages used to build the data stopped working on the server.

## BUT it still works

If you want to use this repository and see what you can achieve with it, you can simply download it. Be aware that it uses Prisma, so you might need to download it first. Refer to their official documentation.

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, set up MongoDB, Google Auth, and GitHub Auth.

### My Experience

Overall, this project was a long and enjoyable one. It taught me:

- Prisma ORM
- Tailwind CSS
- Basic authentication using NextAuth
- Zod for form validation as well as request validation

The only complaint I have is that I wasn't able to finish it to the point I wanted to.
